# Brush App

A toy project to learn about implementing a paint app similar to Clip Studio Paint. We use various optimisation techniques to ensure that our app runs smoothly (60 fps) even for large image sizes and high layer counts (8K x 8K, and up to 200 layers). 

## Build
I don't have a good build system set up yet. This project depends on GLAD, GLFW, and OpenGL.
